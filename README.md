This repo contains everything that is needed to create a Arch Linux ARM image for the Raspberry Pi Zero (or any other Pi with ARM version 6).

Why this script, because it's kinda easy to write the image to a microSD card your self!
That's true but with the Pi Zero that's not as easy as with the other Pi models, because the Pi Zero only have on micro USB connector that's in use for WiFi it's not that easy to put a keyboard to the Pi Zero.
For that reason I created this script that make the Pi Zero headless, it will connect to you're WiFi network and setup root access with SSH, so you don't need to attached a KVM to the Pi.

That's all for now ;-)
